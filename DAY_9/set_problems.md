Here are some Python set-based problems categorized into basic, medium, and hard levels:

---

### **Basic Problems**

1. **Find Common Elements**  
   Given two lists, write a Python program to find the common elements between them using sets.

   ```python
   list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
   # Output: {4, 5}
   ```

2. **Remove Duplicates**  
   Write a Python program to remove duplicates from a list using sets.

   ```python
   lst = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
   # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   ```

3. **Check Subset**  
   Given two sets, check if one set is a subset of the other.

   ```python
   set1 = {1, 2, 3}
   set2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   # Output: True
   ```

4. **Union of Sets**  
   Write a Python program to find the union of two sets.

   ```python
   set1 = {1, 2, 3}
   set2 = {3, 4, 5}
   # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   ```

### **Medium Problems**

1. **Symmetric Difference**  
   Write a Python program to find the symmetric difference between two sets (elements that are in either of the sets but not in their intersection).

   ```python
   set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
   set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
   # Output: {1, 2, 5, 6}
   ```

2. **Count Unique Words**  
   Given a string, write a Python program to count the number of unique words using sets.

   ```python
   text = "hello world hello python world"
   # Output: 3 (unique words: hello, world, python)
   ```

3. **Set Intersection**  
   Given three sets, find the intersection of all three sets.

   ```python
   set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
   set2 = {2, 3, 4, 5}
   set3 = {3, 4, 5, 6}
   # Output: {3, 4}
   ```

4. **Remove Elements from Set**  
   Write a Python program to remove specific elements from a set.

   ```python
   my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   to_remove = {2, 4}
   # Output: {1, 3, 5}
   ```
