Here are the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python and the fundamental class methods and features:

### 1. **Class**:
   A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines the properties and behaviors that the objects will have.

   ```python
   class Person:
       def __init__(self, name, age):
           self.name = name
           self.age = age
   ```

   In this example, `Person` is a class with two properties, `name` and `age`.

### 2. **Object**:
   An object is an instance of a class. Once the class is defined, objects can be created based on it.

   ```python
   person1 = Person("Alice", 30)
   person2 = Person("Bob", 25)
   ```

   Here, `person1` and `person2` are objects of the `Person` class.

### 3. **Attributes (Properties)**:
   Attributes are variables associated with a class. They define the state of an object.

   ```python
   person1.name  # Accessing the attribute of person1 object
   ```

### 4. **Methods**:
   Methods are functions that are defined inside a class and describe the behavior of the objects of that class.

   ```python
   class Person:
       def __init__(self, name, age):
           self.name = name
           self.age = age

       def greet(self):
           print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")
   
   person1 = Person("Alice", 30)
   person1.greet()  # Calling the method
   ```

### 5. **The `__init__` Method (Constructor)**:
   The `__init__` method is a special method that gets called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes.

   ```python
   def __init__(self, name, age):
       self.name = name
       self.age = age
   ```

### 6. **Self**:
   `self` is a reference to the current instance of the class. It is used to access the instance’s attributes and methods within the class.

   ```python
   def greet(self):
       print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name}.")
   ```

### 7. **Encapsulation**:
   Encapsulation is the practice of keeping the internal details of an object hidden from the outside world and only exposing the necessary functionality.

   In Python, this is usually done by using private and public attributes/methods:
   
   ```python
   class Person:
       def __init__(self, name, age):
           self.name = name
           self._age = age  # Private attribute

       def get_age(self):
           return self._age
       
       def set_age(self, age):
           if age > 0:
               self._age = age
   ```

### 8. **Inheritance**:
   Inheritance allows one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class.

   ```python
   class Employee(Person):
       def __init__(self, name, age, job_title):
           super().__init__(name, age)
           self.job_title = job_title
       
       def greet(self):
           print(f"Hello, I am {self.name}, a {self.job_title}.")
   ```

   Here, `Employee` is a subclass of `Person` and inherits its attributes and methods. The `super()` function is used to call the parent class’s `__init__` method.

### 9. **Polymorphism**:
   Polymorphism allows methods to have the same name but behave differently based on the object calling them.

   ```python
   class Dog:
       def speak(self):
           return "Woof"

   class Cat:
       def speak(self):
           return "Meow"
   
   def animal_sound(animal):
       print(animal.speak())
   
   dog = Dog()
   cat = Cat()
   
   animal_sound(dog)  # Outputs: Woof
   animal_sound(cat)  # Outputs: Meow
   ```

### 10. **Abstraction**:
   Abstraction involves hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary functionality. In Python, it can be implemented using abstract classes and methods.

   ```python
   from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
   
   class Animal(ABC):
       @abstractmethod
       def make_sound(self):
           pass
   
   class Dog(Animal):
       def make_sound(self):
           print("Woof")
   
   class Cat(Animal):
       def make_sound(self):
           print("Meow")
   ```

### 11. **Class Methods and Static Methods**:
   - **Class Method**: A method that is bound to the class rather than the instance. It takes `cls` as its first argument, not `self`.

     ```python
     class Person:
         @classmethod
         def class_method(cls):
             print("This is a class method.")
     ```

   - **Static Method**: A method that doesn’t require `self` or `cls`. It’s a simple function within a class.

     ```python
     class Person:
         @staticmethod
         def static_method():
             print("This is a static method.")
     ```

### Summary:
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects.
- **Object**: An instance of a class.
- **Attributes**: Properties or data associated with the class.
- **Methods**: Functions defined within a class.
- **`__init__`**: Constructor used to initialize object properties.
- **Inheritance**: Allows classes to inherit from other classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Allows methods to have the same name but different behavior.
- **Abstraction**: Hides complex implementation details.
- **Encapsulation**: Protects object state by restricting access.
- **Class and Static Methods**: Define methods that belong to the class or are independent of instance data.
