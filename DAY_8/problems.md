[(1, 3), (4, 1), (2, 2)]
```

**Output:**  
```python
[(4, 1), (2, 2), (1, 3)]
```

### Example
**Input:**  
```python
[1, 2, 3]
```

**Output:**  
```python
[[], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
```

### Example
**Input:**  
```python
[1, [2, [3, [4, 5], 6], 7], 8]
```

**Output:**  
```python
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```
